Implementation of the perceptron learniing algorithm

Perceptron learning. Implement the perceptron-learning algorithm (PLA). Choose
three domains from the UCI repository and evaluate the PLAâ€™s behavior for each of
them. Make sure that each domain contains only two classes. Report the results
along the following criteria: (1) error rate measured on an independent testing set,
and (2) computational costs, expressed as the number of example presentations
needed to achieve 100% accuracy. Discuss the different results in each domain.
Apart from domains with linearly separable classes, consider also a domain where
100% accuracy on the training set is impossible to achieve because the classes are
not linearly separable.
